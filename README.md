# AIMIND

The Aeronautical Information Management Integrated data (AIMIND) repository objective is to provide machine readable data out of ICAO documentation that is used in the AIM and similar units. It is intended to provide a way for computers to consume in an easy way data that ICAO still publishes as only PDF instead of other formats. 

It is the responsability of the user to verify that the information is up to date according to ICAO provisions and to report issues in the github tracker with preference to submitting a pull request with the fix if any

For simplicity CSV format has been chosen as initial format 

# CSV available
ICAO abbreviations code/decode
